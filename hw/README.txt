The hardware side of things
===========================

This folder contains:

The STL files for the hand trackers. Probably requires a 3D printer.

 1. Print the sphere white and the rest in black. The handle contains of two seperate halves to simplify assembly
 2. Place LEDs inside sphere. Glue cylinder into sphere. Test-fit cylinder in upper handle hole.
 3. Place an ESP8266, accelerometer and battery inside the handle. Glue together.

 cylinder is also known as "sphere_adapter.stl"

 Hint: Print the handle with a raft or brim, or else it will most likely fall over at 95% progress!
           (ask me how I know)

The PCB for the electronics inside the hand trackers
 For the PCB, you want to use one of three things (In descending order of easiness):
  1. A board manufacturer such as JLC (maybe use a double-sided PCB then)
  2. A CNC
  3. Your perfboard soldering skills
