# Twometer VR
A FREE open-source alternative to commercial hand trackers such as Oculus Touch or PS Move.
Actually, I just want to play Beat Saber, but this sounds nicer.

## Get started
To get started with TwometerVR, check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/Twometer/twometer-vr/wiki)

In the Wiki you will also find setup instructions, implementation details, documentation and more!

## Folder structure
- TVRSvc: The service reading the position and orientation data
- TVRDrv: The driver that maps the server's data to SteamVR
- TVRFw:  The firmware that runs on the controller's chips
- docs:   The protocol specification for the communication between the components
- hw:     STL and PCB files if you want to make this project for yourself

## Thanks!
- OpenCV
- OpenVR
- I2CDev

Without these awesome open-source projects, TwometerVR would not be possible!

## Open Source!
Everything here is released under MIT license,
just have fun with this if you can use it.

Virtual reality for everyone!
