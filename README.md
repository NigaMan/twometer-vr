An open-source alternative to commercial hand trackers such as Oculus Touch or PS Move, because Virtual Reality should not be expensive.

> **Disclaimer**: This project is currently in a beta-state. This means that in general, the system and the controllers are working and you can play VR games with them, I have tested that (a lot). However, you may encounter bugs, crashes, glitches, annyoing setup procedures, unfinished features and the like. If you find any issues, feel free to [report them](https://github.com/Twometer/twometer-vr/issues)
