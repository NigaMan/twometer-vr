# Firmware v2.0

This is the new firmware for the new PCB with the new MPU-9250 sensor.

## Features
- No more yaw drifting due to 9-DOF sensor fusion with the MPU-9250
- Much faster response times and update rates
- More readable, maintainable and cleaner code.

## Dependencies
The firmware requires my ESP8266-modified Sparkfun MPU-9250 DMP library:
