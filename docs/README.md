> Note: It's working, but still under development. That means fancy stuff like setup wizards may not be 100% complete and you may encounter 

A FREE open-source alternative to commercial hand trackers such as Oculus Touch or PS Move.

I built this because I wanted to play Beat Saber without having to buy a new VR headset, so here we go.

## Features
- Very low cost, ~$20 for two controllers
- Works with almost every consumer-grade webcam
- Compatible with SteamVR (yes, the Beat Saber part)
- Fully open-source and free

## Getting started
So, how do I get these controllers, you may ask. Well, I am currently not in the position
to mass-produce these things or even build kits for them, so for now, there are build instructions,
which you can find [here](https://github.com/Twometer/twometer-vr/wiki/Hardware)

After it's done and working, download the software, set it up with the wizard and start playing!
